# Get Brave level adblocking on Vivaldi browser by adding these lists ⚙️Without Any Extensions⚙️

# Filter combination for Vivaldi's Built-in Adblocker

**Important Configuration Notes:**

*   Allow ABP compatible lists to use ABP Snippet rules except lists from Adguard and uBlock.
*   Uncheck the option: "Rules that allow the document type cause all resources to be allowed for matching pages" for all filters except ABP compatible filters.
*   Avoid using unnecessary extra filters beyond those listed below, as incorrect combinations (especially with AdGuard, ABP anti-CV, and uBO filters) can reduce blocking effectiveness.
