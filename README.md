# Get Brave level adblocking on Vivaldi browser by adding these lists ⚙️Without Any Extensions⚙️

# Filter combination for Vivaldi's Built-in Adblocker

Allow every list to use ABP Snippet rules and uncheck "Rules that allow the document type cause all resources to be allowed for
matching pages". Don't use any unnecessary extra filters with the lists below. It can reduce the blocking capability of these filters, specially the wrong combinations of AdGuard, ABP anti-CV and HaGeZi filters.
